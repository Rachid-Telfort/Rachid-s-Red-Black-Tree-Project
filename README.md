Rachidâ€™s Red-Black Tree Project README

About
	This project was a personal project that I did in order to better understand the Red-Black Tree data structure as well as practice my programming skills in C++. This project mainly consists of a menu-driven program that allows one to manipulate a Red-Black Tree in various/interesting ways.
	
Executable File Use
	The execution file is menu driven. When one first opens it up they will be greeted by several prompts that welcomes them to the project. After the welcoming prompts, a menu prompt will appear showing the user the ways one could manipulate the Red-Black Tree (This menu will reappear after every menu choice is processed). For choosing a menu choice to be processed, one first enters the number associated with the menu choice description and presses enter. This will cause the menu choice to be processed which may cause additional prompts to appear guiding you through the processing of the choice (In fact all prompts and menu choices can be processed in a similar way). I understand that these are very basic instructions on how to use the execution file. If one would like more clarification or has suggestions, please comment on the project page on GitHub or email me at rachidtelfort@gmail.com.
